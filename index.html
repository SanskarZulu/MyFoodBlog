    <h3>Oshi Chopra</h3>
    <p>Hello world,<br>
      I'm a girl who lives to eat not eat to be alive. Food has always been my precious. In fact, food is everybody's first priority, so is mine. It really makes your mood good and takes same time as you take to finish a plate. Even if you are going through any ups and downs in life, food has a special place and the love for food always remain strong. This bond is beyond anything. And it is the real "forever and always". </p>
    <p>My love for food made me think "Why not share with the rest of the world wholesome healthy foods and ways to be happy and healthy that will keep even the most snobby foodie asking for more?" Well my answer was here, in this blog. So here you will be able to find loads of fun including healthy recipes to tantalize your taste buds or treat your family.</p>
    <p>Any type of commenting and interaction from you guys is greatly encouraged (even if you disagree with me! and If you do let me know why who knows we might both learn something new) If there is anything you ever want to talk about, or say anything at all, please email me at:
    <a href="mailto:oshichopra258@gmail.com">oshichopra258@gmail.com</a> because I would absolutely love to hear from you guys.<br><br>
      Looking forward to your support! Thankyou!<br>
      Have a great day!</p>

    <h3>Sanskar Sharma</h3>
    <p>Hello world,<br>
      I'm an (special) ordinary boy who loves food the most. Food the most favorite part of everything. This site represents a complex interweaving of  "foodie", interest in cooking, writing about them, and photography. Here, you'll find all kinds of vegetarian dishes and some description about them. I am a type of person who is interested in cooking, clicking pictures and finally eating the food made by myself. I resist myself from sharing my food with anyone but sometimes it seems okay to share love. Many things will come and go, but only food remains your constant. <br><br>
      So, love food, eat healthy and junk as well, eat proper meal. I am really excited to share all my best food and their recipes here. I hope you guys will show some interest or else I know how to be a attention seeker. Get ready for a drooling food ride. It is gonna be a long long journey. All we need is your support. Let the food reach out to everybody. The whole world! <br><br>
      So, be ready to have some fun and be sure to get yourself into this scene! I greatly encourage comments and questions on here. You can email me at 
      <a href="mailto:zulu1999vidhu@gmail.com">zulu1999vidhu@gmail.com</a>.
      Furthermore to know me and my more hobbies and share your food or blogging stories follow my Instagram handle: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sansskarsharma/">sansskarsharma</a><br><br>
      I'm really looking forward to your love and support guys! Thank you!
