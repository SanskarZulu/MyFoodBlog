    <h3>Oshi Chopra</h3>
    <p>Hello world,<br>
      I'm a girl who lives to eat not eat to be alive. Food has always been my precious. In fact, food is everybody's first priority, so is mine. It really makes your mood good and takes same time as you take to finish a plate. Even if you are going through any ups and downs in life, food has a special place and the love for food always remain strong. This bond is beyond anything. And it is the real "forever and always". </p>
    <p>My love for food made me think "Why not share with the rest of the world wholesome healthy foods and ways to be happy and healthy that will keep even the most snobby foodie asking for more?" Well my answer was here, in this blog. So here you will be able to find loads of fun including healthy recipes to tantalize your taste buds or treat your family.</p>
    <p>Any type of commenting and interaction from you guys is greatly encouraged (even if you disagree with me! and If you do let me know why who knows we might both learn something new) If there is anything you ever want to talk about, or say anything at all, please email me at:
    <a href="mailto:oshichopra258@gmail.com">oshichopra258@gmail.com</a></td> because I would absolutely love to hear from you guys.<br><br>
      Looking forward to your support! Thankyou!<br>
      Have a great day!</p>
